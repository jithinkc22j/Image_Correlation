# Image_Correlation

This Matlab code is used to find the Correlation of plain and cipher images.

Note: If you are using my code for your system or project, you should always cite my paper as a reference.

Functions:

   Main function                           : main.m
   
   Correlation function                    : corr.m
   
   Correlation value finding function      : cor_value.m
   
   Correlation figure finding function     : cor_figure.m
   
   
   
Note: The correlation values are hold on 3 sec so you must note it down fast.(by using pause(3) function).
